# Front Door Greeter

This is a front door greeter that displays a logo from the Coder School, and when you connect your motion sensor to the GPIO pin, it will spin the logo in place, and play an audio recording.

I made this project to be a door greeter for The Coder School, but of course you can exchange the logo and audio files for ones of your own. =}


## Getting Started

This works best on a Raspberry Pi. Make sure you have Pigame, connect your motion sensor to GPIO pin number 4.
open and run "run.py" to start the program.

Use the space bar to toggle between full screen and a resizable screen.
